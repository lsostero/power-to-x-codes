the .m files are matlab files that simulates the proces of a power-to-methanol\ammonia chain. 
for some codes it is needed to import some data set to matlab. All the data must be imported as column vectors
engine simulations: in order to start the engine simulations the electricity price from the file "X ECONOMIC ANALISIS" take the last coloumn on the left and import it as a column vector. Then it is possible to run the simulations. The fuel price can be changed manually on the code.
synthesis simulation: t
