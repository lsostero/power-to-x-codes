The .m files are MATLAB files that simulate the process of a power-to-methanol/ammonia chain.
Some scripts require importing datasets into MATLAB. All data must be imported as column vectors.

Engine simulations

To start the engine simulations, import the electricity price from the file "X ECONOMIC ANALYSIS" by taking the last column on the right and loading it as a column vector. Then, you can run the simulations. The fuel price can be adjusted manually in the code.

Synthesis simulation

These files use the same data import method as the engine simulations.

File: BATTERY, WINDPLUS HYDROGEN STORAGE

The wind velocity (half-hourly basis) and wind turbine power must be imported as column vectors from the file "wind speed".
